# Comprehension and Interpretation of Computer Code as a Function of Typography

*by Liran Sharir, Rom Cohen and David Hachuel*



#### Abstract

We chose the paper below as the base for our research project because we are interested in extending North and Jenkins research to a specific domain. In particular, we would like to measure the effect of typography in computer code on the speed and effectiveness of its understanding.

#### Summary of Experiment

##### Hypothesis

There is a difference in the ability of a programmer to understand and interpret code given different monospaced fonts. 

##### Sampling Method and Size

We plan to survey about 30 experienced programmers. We control the variability of programmer skills by presenting easy/simple code. We choose to perform random sampling on a population of graduate students in computer science in the New York area.

##### Dependent and Independent Variables and Measurement

For independent variables we choose three typeface styles (monospaced serif, monospace sans-serif and monospaced decorative). We choose as dependent variables the following: speed (in seconds) of understanding algorithm purpose, comprehension (# of correct questions) and accuracy (% correct answers).
